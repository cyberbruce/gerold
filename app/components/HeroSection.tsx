              <div className="space-y-4 text-lg text-gray-600">
                <p>
               Gerold is a barrow, white, crossbred pig. Throughout his journey, he has experienced both challenges and progress.
</p>
<p>
Gerold began his training in the showpen, demonstrating strong natural posture and a solid walking pace. In the early weeks, he made steady progress as he and his handler, Savannah, focused on building consistent technique. However, Gerold soon began to show signs of resistance-attempting to wander off, refusing to walk, and becoming increasingly stubborn.
</p>
<p>
After taking a short break and seeing no improvement, Savannah made the decision to stay committed and work through the difficulties. 
With patience and determination, she continued to guide Gerold, encouraging him to walk even short distances within the show pen,
 and around the farm. Several days of persistence and plenty of squealing, Gerold finally responded. He began walking again.
</p>
<p>
Now Gerold and Savannah train daily around the farm. He stays by her side, maintaining a steady pace, and showing improvement with each session. Together, they continue to practice, develop new skills, and prepare for the upcoming Tulare County Fair.

                <p>
                  Hello, I am Savannah Silveira, this is my first year raising a hog, and this was my experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Going into this journey I was terrified, thinking I wouldn't have the talent to do it, and wasn't experienced enough. Going into that, I was ending my 8th grade year, which would mean I would be with a bunch of high schoolers that I don't know. May 10th, picking day‚Äîoh my gosh was I nervous. So many things were going through my head that day, thinking about how this had to be the perfect pig, and if it wasn't I wouldn't be good enough.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When I was picking I had my eye on a Hampshire hog, and thought it was perfect, but I looked way down at the end of the pen, and saw a Yorkshire hog. From that point on I knew he was the one. Once I picked him out I had no idea what to do, or even how to get him to his pen. He was in his pen, and I was just looking at him making sure he looked good. I realized‚Äîwow I'm actually doing this.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Day one of taking care of my pig, and I had no idea what to do, looking around at what experienced people were doing. First couple of weeks go by and I know mostly what to do, but still unsure of a couple things. Our first showmanship practice was coming up and I was so scared. I just knew my pig was going to run away from me, and I would get out first. But little did I know I was one of the last people in the pen. After that practice I felt so confident, knowing my pig probably didn't even need practice, but that's where it all went wrong.

                  I didn't walk my pig for about 4 weeks, almost a month. Didn't want to walk around the farm, in the show pen, or even the direction I wanted him to go in. All he knew where to go was the wash pens, and his pen. I knew I made the biggest mistake of my journey. Thinking I should've walked him the first month I had him, but instead I didn't.
                </p>
                <p>
                  So I decided to not let him get what he wants, and pushed him to his limits. That was a hard part, he knew that after I washed him he would get food. That day I didn't give him food right away, after washing him, and pushed him into the showmanship pen. He was breathing so heavy, and realized he was really out of shape. Driving home that day I just wanted to cry, knowing I would never be able to get him walking again. I was hopeless.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A couple days later, I tried walking him, again, and again, he didn't want to. Little did I know that I just had to be more aggressive with him, and would not let him choose where he wanted to go. After that day when I was hard on him, he finally started to listen. Sure enough he was walking around the pen, I couldn't believe my eyes. Yes, he was running half the time, but sure enough I got him to calm down.

                  Next thing I know, he is walking right next to me, showing massive progress. I finally felt achieved in my journey, and that I could do anything. So if you ever feel hopeless, and just want to give up, don't, because if you just keep pushing yourself, you will feel accomplished in the end.
